Title: Low Cost Fuel Oil Monitoring
Save_As: fuel-mon/oil-fuel-mon.html

Loeffler Engineering and Analysis North, with funding from the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation,
are developing a relatively low cost method for measuring and recording oil fuel consumption.
The technique being developed uses an ultrasonic distance measuring device to determine the height
of fuel in a fuel tank. From changes in the fuel height, the amount of fuel use will be determined.
The measurement system will also include a fuel temperature sensor so that changes in fuel height
due to thermal expansion and contraction can be adjusted for.

This system will also be useful for determining when a fuel tank is approaching empty.

The distance measuring device is manufactured by Maxbotix.  It can measure
short distances, a valuable characteristic when taking measurements of a very full tank.  The
measuring device comes with a threaded housing that will allow easy installation into a threaded
bung present on most fuel tanks.  Here is a picture of the ultransonic distance measuring device:

We will update this page as progress is made on the fuel oil mesurement system.  The project
is expected to be complete by April 2022.
