Loeffler Engineering and Analysis North, with funding from the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation,
are developing a relatively low cost method for measuring and recording oil fuel consumption.
The technique being developed uses an ultrasonic distance measuring device to determine the height
of fuel in a fuel tank. From changes in the fuel height, the amount of fuel use will be determined.
The measurement system will also include a fuel temperature sensor so that changes in fuel height
due to thermal expansion and contraction can be adjusted for.

This system will also be useful for determining when a fuel tank is approaching empty.

The distance measuring device is manufactured by Maxbotix.  Its can measure
short distances, which is valuable when taking measurements of a very full tank.  The measuring device
comes with a threaded housing that will allow easy installation into an existing threaded
bung present on most fuel tanks.  Here is a picture of the ultransonic distance measuring unit, not installed:

We will update this page as progress is made on the fuel oil mesurement system.
