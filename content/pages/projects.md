### 2018 Alaska Mini-Split Heat Pump Study

This Study addressed the performance and financial impact of using 
Ductless "Mini-Split" heat pumps in Alaska.  The various components of the study,
with associated report and calculator links, are summarized below.

The contract for this study was managed by the *Northwest Arctic Borough*, and
funding for the study was provided by:

* Homer Electric Association
* Alaska Energy Authority
* Alaska Housing Financce Corporation
* Northwest Arctic Borough
* NANA Regional Corporation
* Taġiuġmiullu Nunamiullu Housing Authority
* Alaska Power & Telephone
* Alaska Village Electric Cooperative

Special thanks to Brian Hirsch of Deerstone Consulting for recognizing the
need for this study and Calculator, and for his efforts to assemble interested
parties to sponsor the study.


#### Alaska Mini-Split Heat Pump Calculator

A web-based calculator was developed to estimate the performance and financial return of
installing a mini-split heat pump in a home in Alaska.  Community-specific 
climate, fuel cost, and electric utility rate information is available in the 
Calculator for most communities in Alaska.  Try out the Calculator here:

As well as work by Alan Mitchell of Analysis North, this calculator benefited extensively
from contributions by Phil Kaluza of Arctic Energy Systems, Dustin Madden and Kristen Thomas
of the Cold Climate Housing Research Center, and detailed review and suggestions for improvement
by Ingemar Mathiasson of the Northwest Arctic Borough.

A number of different field studies of the performance of mini-split heat pumps were
reviewed to develop a performance algorithm for use in the Calculator.  This
report summarizes the development of the algorithms and data that are used in the
Calculator:

#### Cost-Effective Applications and Performance Observations

From use of the Heat Pump Calculator described above,
conclusions can be drawn about the situations where Mini-Split Heat Pumps
are cost-effective in Alaska.  The Calculator and work related to
development of the Calculator also provide other useful observations about the
performance and benefits of mini-split heat pump use in Alaska.  Here is the report:

#### Electric Utility Issues Related to Heat Pump Use in Alaska

For electric utilities where marginal generation costs are less than the retail rates, 
the added electricity sales from use of heat pumps will
reduce rates for all customers. Further, use of heat pumps oftentimes
has the social benefit of reduced greenhouse gas emissions and increased energy efficiency.
This report gives guidance on how electric utilities can provide incentives to customers
for installation of heat pumps:

Extensive use of heat pumps will impact electric utility system loads.
This report addresses the utility system impacts imposed by use of mini-split 
heat pumps:
