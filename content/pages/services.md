### Software Development

Analysis North has developed a wide variety of software related to building energy use 
and data acquistion.  We were the original developer of the 
[AkWarm Home Energy Rating and Commerical Building Energy Analysis 
software](https://www.ahfc.us/efficiency/learn-and-diy/research-information-center/ric-links-interest/akwarm-energy-rating-software/), 
owned by the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation. This Visual Basic .Net
application is the official Home Energy Rating software for the State of Alaska and has been 
used by hundreds or Energy Raters and Energy Analysts. We are
currently on contract to the [Cold Climate Housing Research
Center](https://www.cchrc.org/) to maintain and upgrade that software. Further
information about the software is available from the [AkWarm 2 Download Page.](/AkWarm/AkWarm2download.html)

Analysis North has developed web applications for collecting and analyzing building
energy use and environmental data.  These projects are discussed in the next section and 
use the versatile and productive [Python programming language](https://python.org).  We also have 
developed custom data acquistion hardware using the C programming language for
embedded microcontrollers and the Python language for programming small Linux
computers such as the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/).

### Data Acquisition and Analysis Projects

Analysis North has designed and installed a number of data acquisition and
data analysis projects related to building energy use and general facility monitoring.
The data acquistion systems for the projects generally provide real-time
data available on the Internet. The systems use wireless sensor systems or low-cost 
Linux computers and data acquisition hardware combined with custom software written by Analysis
North. Recent projects include:

  * Designing and installing the hardware and software to monitor three public housing facilities
  owned by the Alaska Housing Finance corporation.  Wireless sensors, data extraction
  from building control systems, and data from Internet sources were all used to provide
  data for reducing builing energy consumption and improving facility operation.  The
  project web site with real-time data, training videos, and project reports 
  [is available here](https://bms.ahfc.us/).
  * Assisting the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium in their efforts to remotely
  monitor water and sewer systems in Rural Alaska.  We helped with harware selection and
  customization and developed a [web application to view the collected 
  data](https://rm.anthc.webfactional.com/).
  * Monitoring, analyzing, and improving the energy efficiency of a sidewalk 
  snowmelt system at a large senior housing complex.
  * Monitoring the system parameters of a solar thermal and wood boiler heating plant 
  for a straw-bale residence. Real-time data is available 
  [at this site](https://bmon.analysisnorth.com/reports/?select_group=0&select_bldg=4&select_chart=0).
  * Programming a [custom web page](https://analysisnorth.com/enphase/solar_summary.html) 
  for displaying production data from the Analysis North Solar PV system.

Analysis North also designed and commericalized the battery-powered _Runtime
DataWatcher_ datalogger, optimized for recording the hourly runtime of
boilers, furnaces, hot water heaters, and electrical appliances. While
currently not in production, information on the product is [available
here](https://energytools.com/DataWatcher.htm).

### Economic Analysis

Analysis North has extensive experience analyzing the costs and benefits of
energy projects, including design optimization based on life-cycle cost
techniques. For three years we have provided economic review of projects seeking funding from
Alaska's Renewable Energy Fund. We have also performed benefit/cost analysis
of a number of multi-million dollar electric utility projects, including power
plants and transmission lines.

Analysis North teamed with Alaska Map Science to create the economic model
used by General Communication Inc. (GCI) to win $41 million in a federal auction
for providing 3G Wireless service to Alaska Native and U.S. Tribal lands.
