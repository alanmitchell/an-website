### Software Requirements and Installation

-   **You must have Microsoft Word version 2003, 2007, or later to view
    and print out the Improvement Options Report.**
-   Your operating system must be Windows XP or later. 
    If you are using Windows XP, your installation must have at least
    Service Pack 2 installed. To install the most recent Windows XP
    Service pack, go to the 
    [Windows XP Service Pack 3 web page.](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/322389)
-   Click the button above to download the setup
    program for the AkWarm 2 software. After clicking the button you may
    be able to directly "Run" the setup program or you may be forced to
    save it to your hard drive. If you save it to the hard drive, you
    should then "Open" the saved file or double-click it to start the
    installation program.

### Important Notes

-   For some computers, the installer will first install the Microsoft
    .Net Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 (SP1), which could take as long as
    40 minutes on slow Internet connections. All installations of future
    releases of AkWarm on your same computer will not require this
    lengthy process and will install quickly.
-   After installing the software, you should have an icon on your
    desktop to run the software or you can find the program in the
    "AkWarm" program group under the start menu.
