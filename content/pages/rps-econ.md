Title: Railbelt Renewable Portfolio Standard: Economic Analysis
Save_As: rps-econ.html

The Alaska State Legislature is currently debating bills (Senate Bill 179 and House Bill 301) that establish a
Renewable Portfolio Standard for the Alaskan Railbelt region. The bills require
80% renewable electricity production by the year 2040.  The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)
<a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy22osti/81698.pdf" target="_blank">completed a study</a> that identifies five 
different Scenarios that can
achieve the 80% target.  Analysis North took the results from Scenario #3 (additional renewable generation is 
primarily wind and solar) and performed a very preliminary economic benefit/cost analysis.  Results were quite
favorable (benefits were two times the costs), indicating that a more thorough economic analysis is
clearly justified.

Clicking the image below will show three slides summarizing the results.
